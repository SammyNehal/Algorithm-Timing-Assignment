# This program allows you to see how fast bubble sort, quick sort, and the python sort run.
## The output is colour coded, red for the times, green for the total times, blue for the average time (RGB).
### This program will slowdown when you go reach a data-set size of 25,000 and beyond, due to the fact that bubble-sort is incredibly slow at larger data-set sizes. I have not implemented a way for you to choose what sorting method you want, so it will run all of them, one after the other. I've created a file with the Bubble sort code commented out, and another file to go beyond the recursion limit, so that you can test sizes of 100,000 value and higher.
### The algorithims are ran in this order: bubble sort, quick sort, and built-in sort.
